# Document Object Model (DOM)

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; thus, programming languages like JavaScript can interact with the page dynamically.
