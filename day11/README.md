# Day 4: Async/Await and Advanced Promises

This lesson covers:

- Using **async/await** syntax for cleaner asynchronous code
- Creating custom Promises with time delays and conditional resolution
- Resolving multiple Promises simultaneously with `Promise.all`

---

## Topics Explained

### Async/Await

- Simplifies Promise-based asynchronous code.
- `async` functions return Promises.
- `await` pauses execution until a Promise resolves.

### Custom Promises with setTimeout

- Simulates delayed async operations.
- Demonstrates resolving or rejecting based on conditions (e.g., even/odd number).

### Promise.all

- Runs multiple Promises concurrently.
- Resolves when all input Promises resolve.
- Useful for parallel asynchronous tasks.
